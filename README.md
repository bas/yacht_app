# Yacht App

A Flutter learning project that implements [Yacht (dice game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_(dice_game)). This app uses stateless widgets with a [provider](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple) to manage state. This allows for very clean separation of concerns.
